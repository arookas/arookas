_arookas library_ (or _alib_ for short) is a basic C# library containing a potpourri types and utility methods that are used in almost all of my programs. If you're building one of my other repositories, you're probably going to need this.

### Compiling

To make building _alib_ easier, the repository contains a [premake5](https://premake.github.io/) script that generates a solution ready for building. Simply run the script through _premake5_ and you should be good to go.

### License

_alib_ (thus, including all the files in this repository) is licensed under the MIT license (see [here](LICENSE) for more information).
